In this scenario, *ReneWind* aims to proactively address wind turbine generator failures by developing a classification model to predict failures before they occur. This setup involves:

1. **Data Overview**:
   - **Dataset**: Contains 40 predictor variables with 20,000 observations in the training set and 5,000 in the test set.
   - **Target Variable**: Binary, where `1` represents a failure and `0` indicates no failure.

2. **Objective**:
   - To build and tune classification models that accurately predict generator failures, prioritizing models that reduce the likelihood of undetected failures (False Negatives) due to high replacement costs.

3. **Cost Analysis of Predictions**:
   - **True Positive (TP)**: Correct prediction of a failure—results in repair costs, which are lower than replacement.
   - **False Negative (FN)**: Missed failure—leads to replacement costs, the most expensive scenario.
   - **False Positive (FP)**: Incorrectly predicting a failure—results in inspection costs, which are less than repair costs but still add to operational expenses.

4. **Model Selection & Tuning**:
   - The model should ideally maximize recall (minimizing False Negatives) to reduce replacement costs.
   - Given the cost structure, a high recall (sensitivity) is prioritized over precision, aiming to catch as many failures as possible even if it results in more inspections.

**Potential Models**:
- *Logistic Regression*, *Random Forests*, *Gradient Boosting*, and *Neural Networks* could be tested, followed by tuning hyperparameters to enhance predictive performance on generator failures.

By effectively tuning and selecting the best model, ReneWind can minimize maintenance costs and optimize repair scheduling to keep turbines operational and reduce overall costs.
